# Maze Algorithms
Maze Algorithms is an algorithm visualizer built with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 
It uses the generation and solving of mazes in order to visualize how particular algorithms work.

## Maze Generation

Mazes can be generated using 3 different algorithms: depth-first, breadth-first, or union-find.

## Maze Solving

Mazes can be solved currently using either a depth-first approach or breadth-first approach.
